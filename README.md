# <strong>R</strong>esearch <strong>Ethi</strong>cs on <strong>C</strong>yber<strong>s</strong>ecurity (REthiCs) Project

The mission of <strong>R</strong>esearch <strong>Ethi</strong>cs on <strong>C</strong>yber<strong>s</strong>ecurity (REthiCs) Project is to support ethical considerations in cybersecurity research for ICT researchers.
The project provides the checklist to avoid common pitfalls in cybersecurity research ethics and deploys it to various ICT research communities.

## Background and Objectivesï¼š

ICT Researchers might conduct experiments that are difficult to prevent harm to the participants or other stakeholders entirely or might discover a vulnerability of existing systems or products through experiments.
There would be necessary some research ethics for cybersecurity, such as research protocols and responsible disclosures to ICT researchers.
In response to the growing importance of such research ethics, the project has been established by volunteers to support ethical considerations for ICT researchers.

## Scope:

In-Scope: Cybersecurity research ethics

Out of Scope: General research ethics, Misconduct in research

## Goals:

The popularization of ethical consideration in cybersecurity research
